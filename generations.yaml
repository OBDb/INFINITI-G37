  - name: "First Generation (V36) Coupe"
    start_year: 2008
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The Infiniti G37 Coupe was the successor to the G35 Coupe, featuring more aggressive styling with muscular fenders, a lower roofline, and sharper overall design. Built on an evolved version of Nissan's FM (Front Midship) platform, it maintained the front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout that defined the G series. Powered by a larger 3.7L VQ37VHR V6 engine producing 330 HP, paired with either a seven-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission, it offered enhanced performance over its predecessor. The interior saw significant improvements in material quality, design, and technology, featuring a more premium feel with available features like a hard-drive based navigation system, Bose premium audio, and adaptive climate control. Available in multiple trims including the performance-oriented Sport and all-wheel drive models in some markets, it catered to different buyer preferences. A convertible variant (G37 Convertible) with a power-retractable hardtop was introduced in 2009, expanding the model's appeal. The G37 Coupe successfully built upon the foundation established by the G35, offering competitive performance against established luxury sports coupes like the BMW 3 Series Coupe while maintaining its value proposition."

  - name: "First Generation (V36) Sedan"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The G37 Sedan replaced the G35 Sedan in Infiniti's lineup, featuring updated styling consistent with the coupe but with a more practical four-door configuration. Sharing its platform and mechanical components with the coupe, it benefited from the same 3.7L VQ37VHR V6 engine producing 328 HP, paired with either a seven-speed automatic or six-speed manual transmission. Available in rear-wheel or all-wheel drive configurations and multiple trim levels including luxury-oriented Journey and performance-focused Sport models, it offered options for different driving preferences. The interior featured improved materials, design, and technology compared to its predecessor, with available features like dual-zone climate control, a rearview camera, and Infiniti's first implementation of the dual-touchscreen infotainment system in later years. This generation maintained the G sedan's position as a sport-luxury alternative to established European competitors, particularly appealing to buyers seeking driving enjoyment combined with Japanese reliability. In 2014, as part of Infiniti's nomenclature change, the G sedan was renamed Q50, while the coupe and convertible became the Q60, bringing an end to the G designation that had become synonymous with Infiniti's sport-luxury identity."
